# Rotate to Plane

![Paper pop-up model being folded](paper_popup_model.gif)

Rotate object to position a point perfectly on a plane.
This is an inference ("On Radius") that's missing in the native Rotate tool.

Can be used to lean a ladder against a wall but was designed and streamlined for
folding paper to the right angle in pop-up models.
