# Rotate to Plane

![Paper pop-up model being folded](paper_popup_model.gif)

Rotate object to position a point perfectly on a plane.
This is an inference ("On Radius") that's missing in the native Rotate tool.

Useful e.g. for leaning a ladder against a wall, or folding paper to the right angle when making pop-up models.
